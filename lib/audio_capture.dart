/// Abstract base class for audio capture functionality.
/// 
/// This class defines the common interface for capturing audio from different sources
/// (microphone or system audio). Implementations include [MicAudioCapture] and
/// [SystemAudioCapture].
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final audioCapture = MicAudioCapture();
/// await audioCapture.initialize();
/// await audioCapture.startCapture();
/// 
/// // Listen to audio stream
/// audioCapture.audioStream?.listen((audioData) {
///   // Process audio data
/// });
/// 
/// // Stop when done
/// await audioCapture.stopCapture();
/// await audioCapture.dispose();
/// ```
abstract class AudioCapture {
  /// Whether the audio capture is currently recording.
  /// 
  /// Returns `true` if capture is active, `false` otherwise.
  /// 
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// if (audioCapture.isRecording) {
  ///   print('Audio capture is active');
  /// }
  /// ```
  bool get isRecording;

  /// Disposes of the audio capture instance and releases all resources.
  /// 
  /// This method should be called when the capture instance is no longer needed.
  /// It will automatically stop any active capture.

  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// await audioCapture.dispose();
  /// ```

/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final config = MicAudioConfig(
///   sampleRate: 44100,
///   channels: 2,
/// );
/// final capture = MicAudioCapture(config: config);
/// ```
